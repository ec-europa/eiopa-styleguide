# Typography

Be careful when applying the `.ecl-typography` class.

If you embed the EIOPA in an existing website, don't apply this class on the `body` or it will affect the existing styles. Apply it on the top-level EIOPA element.

If the EIOPA is your main framework, then you can add the `.ecl-typography` class to the `body` element.
